🚗 Toll Pay App (Academic Project)
📘 Academic Disclaimer

This project is developed strictly for academic and learning purposes only.
All payment-related features are dummy / simulated, and no real monetary transactions are processed.

📱 Project Overview

Toll Pay App is an Android-based mobile application prototype that demonstrates how toll payments can be initiated remotely using a smartphone.
The application focuses on user authentication, toll booking, and simulated toll payment workflows, while leveraging Firebase services for backend operations.

This project is intended to showcase practical implementation of mobile app development concepts rather than real-world financial transactions.

🎯 Project Objectives

Learn and implement Android app development using Java and XML

Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Firebase

Simulate a remote toll payment workflow

Understand real-world mobile app architecture and data handling

🔑 Key Features
Firebase-powered user and toll data management

CRUD operations for toll booking and payment records

Dummy payment simulation for toll transactions

Booking confirmation and transaction flow

Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

Android Studio

Java

XML

Firebase Authentication

Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore

Git & GitHub

🔄 Firebase Integration

Firebase is used for:

User authentication and session handling

Storing user profile details

Managing toll booking records

Performing CRUD operations on simulated payment data

💡 Payment Simulation Notice

All payment-related operations in this application are mock implementations.
No real payment gateway, banking API, or financial service is integrated.
The payment flow exists only to demonstrate how a toll payment system might function in practice.

📚 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with Firebase backend services

Practical exposure to Android UI development

Experience in integrating frontend and backend components

Insight into designing real-world mobile app workflows

📌 Conclusion

The Toll Pay App serves as a working academic prototype that demonstrates the concept of remote toll payments using mobile technology.
It is intended purely for educational and demonstration purposes and does not represent a production-ready payment system.
